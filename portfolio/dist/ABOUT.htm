<font face="Times New Roman" size="5">The Distribut-Air system is the most flexible and 

versatile means of distributing a continuous supply of air to pneumatic 

equipment. This system incorporates many outstanding features to increase the 

efficiency of assembly lines, materials handling systems, and other production 

operations.</font><p align = "left"> <font face="Times New Roman" size="5">The Distribut 

- Air system supplies air through a manifold consisting of an aluminum extrusion 

with flexible neoprene insert. Air is extracted from the manifold, with 

portable plugs for stationary applications, or rolling take-off wheels for 

moving conveyor applications and materials handling operations.</font><p align = "left"> 

<font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Distribut - Air&nbsp; provides safety and 

flexibility where pneumatic systems are used. In addition to eliminating the 

need for long air hoses, this system offers many operating advantages. Some of 

these advantages are listed here:</font><ul>

  <li>

<p align = "left"> <b><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">CONTINUOUS AIR SUPPLY</font></b></li>

</ul>

<p align = "left"> <font face="Times New Roman" size="5">The Distribut-Air system 

provides a constant supply of compressed air at any point along the entire 

length of the system, permitting tool operators to move from one point to 

another with no interruption or effect on performance of air tools.</font><ul>

  <li>

<p align = "left"> <b><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">COMPACT- LIGHTWEIGHT</font></b></li>

</ul>

<p align = "left"> <font face="Times New Roman" size="5">The Distribut-Air system is 

constructed of aluminum extrusion and castings designed to provide dependable 

performance and neat appearance.&nbsp; The aluminum construction also eliminates 

rust and scale which normally contaminate other compressed air distribution 

systems.</font><ul>

  <li>

<p align = "left"> <b><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">INSTALLATION FLEXIBILITY</font></b></li>

</ul>

<p align = "left"> <font size="5">Modifications are easily accomplished by installing 

additional sections of the manifold with the trolley and plugs whenever desired 

to meet the changing requirements of production operations. The air supply for 

assembly tools can be revised or repolished easily at minimum cost.</font><ul>

  <li>

<p align = "left"> <b><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">VERSATILE OPERATION</font></b></li>

</ul>

<p align = "left"> <font size="5">The Distribut - Air system is available with power-type 

trolley, tow-type trolley, or portable plugs to meet the requirements of each 

application. Any number of trolleys and/or portable plugs can be used 

simultaneously on the same section.</font><ul>

  <li>

<p align = "left"> <b><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">EASY INSTALLATION</font></b></li>

</ul>

<p align = "left"> <font size="5">Installations are completed in a minimum period of time. The 

duct is easily installed on a wall, ceiling, or over or under assembly lines for 

use with pneumatic tools. The rail is suspended overhead by means of suspension 

clamps for use with air hoists on a bridge cranes and mono rail systems.</font><ul>

  <li>

<p align = "left"> <b><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">MAXIMUM SAFETY</font></b></li>

</ul>

<p align = "left"> <font size="5">Improved safety conditions are obtained with this system. It 

is suitable for installation in hazardous areas as it eliminates excessive and 

unnecessary hose in work areas, eliminates shock hazard, and reduces damage to 

tools caused by dropping.</font><p align = "left"> &nbsp;<ul>

  <li>

<p align = "left"> <b><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">INFINITE APPLICATION</font></b></li>

</ul>

<p align = "left"> <font size="5">Modular sections are supplied in straight sections of&nbsp; 

5, 10, AND 20-foot lengths - and curved sections of 36-inch radius or larger. 

Provisions are made to connect any combination of sections together to obtain an 

infinite variety of configurations to fit all applications.</font></body></html>
